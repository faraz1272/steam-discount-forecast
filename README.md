# Steam Discount Forecast

This project aims to predict when newly released Steam games are likely to go on sale.  
Gamers often make impulse purchases at full price, only to see the game discounted shortly after release.  
By analyzing historical pricing trends, publisher behavior, reviews, and release data, this project helps gamers make smarter buying decisions, whether to buy now or wait.
